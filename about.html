        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I attended Norman North High School, and graduated in 2019 with a 3.81 GPA as a member of the National Honor Society, as well as Norman North's Key Club. The following term, I was admitted to the College of Engineering at the University of Oklahoma. However, I did not feel at home at all in that college, so after my first semester, I transferred to the Price College of Business, where I am currently working toward a major in MIS and a minor in Accounting. As of December 2021, I have a 4.0 GPA in my MIS degree. </p>

        <h3>Personal</h3>
        <p>I was born and grew up in Norman, Oklahoma, where the University of Oklahoma is situated. Growing up, I'd always lived within 5 miles of it, and knew from an early age that I would study there after high school, since both of my parents graduated from OU. In my freetime I enjoy spending time with friends, reading, writing, doing tracings of artwork, as well as playing video games. Sometimes I go out for long drives in the countryside near Lake Thunderbird, something I find very relaxing and liberating.</p>
